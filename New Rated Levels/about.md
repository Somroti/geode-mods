# <cy>New Rated Levels</c>
Add more rated levels, with lower standards rate like 1.0 gameplay, 1.5, 2.0... All the levels can be rated! Go on the More Rated Levels website for submit levels (SOON)

#  <cr>WARNING</c>
This mod could be considered **cheating** because it modifies stats. Therefore, **a ban from the leaderboard is possible.** In the future, I will add a setting to disable receiving stars.

## Thanks
Thanks to the amazing [hiimjasmine00](https://geode-sdk.org/mods?developer=hiimjasmine00) for creating the mod [Fake Rate](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/hiimjustin000.fake_rate)!

### How this mod work with others
This mod works with [More Difficulties](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/uproxide.more_difficulties) and [Demons In Between](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/hiimjustin000.demons_in_between) (these mods are incredibles).
For an unknown reason, **Levels Thumbnails doesn't work** (if you want to know, when you click by a modified level, the game crash lmao)
